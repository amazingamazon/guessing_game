This is a guessing game. Follow the prompts as they appear on your screen.

You will be asked to guess how many hours I've played my favorite mobile game: MineCraft Sweeper.

When the first box pops up, type in your guess. Press OK. Through computer wizardry, your guess will be compared against the actual hours I've logged in the game.

You will be notified if your guess is too high or too low. Refresh if you don't get it right the first time.

It's fun for the whole family!
