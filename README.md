This is a guessing game. Follow the prompts as they appear on your screen.

You will be asked to guess how many hours I've played my favorite mobile game: MineCraft Sweeper.

When the first box pops up, type in your guess. Press OK. Through computer wizardry, your guess will be compared against the actual hours I've logged in the game.

You will be notified if your guess is too high or too low. If you've guessed more than 10 times, the game will ask you if you want to try again.  If you say OK, the game will start over.  Otherwise, it will end and thank you for playing.

If you guess correctly, the game will ask you if you want to download MineCraft Sweeper.  If you click OK, it will redirect you to the appropriate page of the Google Play Store.

It's fun for the whole family!
